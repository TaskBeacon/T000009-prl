# CHANGELOG

All notable development changes for T000009-prl are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- Added full literature contract bundle under `references/`:
  - `references.yaml`
  - `references.md`
  - `parameter_mapping.md`
  - `stimulus_mapping.md`
  - `task_logic_audit.md`
  - curated `selected_papers.json`

### Changed
- Refactored `src/run_trial.py` to use `psyflow` native `next_trial_id()` and removed legacy internal `_next_trial_id` and `_deadline_s` boilerplate.
- Renamed choice-stage runtime label and config keys:
  - `cue` -> `choice`
  - `timing.cue_duration` -> `timing.choice_duration`
  - `triggers.map.cue_onset` -> `triggers.map.choice_onset`
- Updated block/total score aggregation keys in `main.py` from `cue_delta` to `choice_delta`.
- Rewrote `config/config.yaml` and `config/config_qa.yaml` in clean UTF-8 to remove mojibake and align section structure.
- Updated sampler responder to always progress instruction/block/goodbye screens in simulation mode.
- Updated README terminology and trigger/timing labels to match runtime implementation.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-18
- Refactored responder context phase names in `src/run_trial.py` to task-specific labels (removed generic MID-style phase naming).
- Updated stage comments in `src/run_trial.py` to phase-aligned labels for cleaner auditability.
- Updated `README.md` to keep runtime phase documentation aligned with the implemented trial context phases.

### Fixed
- Removed legacy stage comment patterns (`cue/anticipation/target/feedback`) from trial runtime code.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- Added mode-aware main.py flow for human, qa, and sim modes.
- Added split runtime configs: config/config.yaml, config/config_qa.yaml, config/config_scripted_sim.yaml, and config/config_sampler_sim.yaml.
- Added task-local responder scaffold in 
esponders/task_sampler.py.
- Added outputs/.gitkeep and standardized output folders for human/qa/sim runs.

### Changed
- Aligned trigger config to structured schema (	riggers.map, 	riggers.driver, 	riggers.policy, 	riggers.timing).
- Aligned src/run_trial.py to set responder trial context via set_trial_context(...) at response windows.
- Added/updated 	askbeacon.yaml with contracts.psyflow_taps: v0.1.0.
- Updated .gitignore to match standardized task artifacts and output handling.

### Verified
- psyflow-validate <task> passes all contract checks (including artifacts).
- psyflow-qa <task> --config config/config_qa.yaml --no-maturity-update passes.
- python main.py sim --config config/config_scripted_sim.yaml runs successfully and writes sim outputs.
